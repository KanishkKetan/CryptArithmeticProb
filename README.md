# CryptArithmeticProb
Cryptarithmetic Problem is a type of constraint satisfaction problem where the game is about digits and its unique replacement either with alphabets or other symbols.
In cryptarithmetic problem, the numeric digits (0-9) get substituted by some possible alphabets.
The task in cryptarithmetic problem is to substitute each digit with an alphabet to get the result arithmetically correct.
We can perform all the arithmetic operations on a given cryptarithmetic problem.
This a simple code in C to solve a given cryptarithmetic problem.
